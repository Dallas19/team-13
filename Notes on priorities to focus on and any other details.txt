UI Design : Things to not forget
- reference website layout
- how does it connect to the match algo.
- depict results of matching
  - allow choice to show results of diff algo 
  - presc. for company
  - how does co. know they have been declined
  - student goes back into queue?
This issue comes in due to this coming into waves.
Don't forget to state assumptions when doing things and presenting. 
Also reference how it can provide future/long term solutions


Focus : matching engine click button and now show interview schedule
what would you like to know if you were them?
how to represent data

1. Show student & company mock up of ranking
-input structure
2. Matching process
-result of interview process
-depiect schedule
-are spots empty or filled up?
-show stats
